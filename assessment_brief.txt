Case Study: “TechReads Retail Analytics”   
TechReads is a mid-sized UK company specialising in online sales analytics for technical books. 
Their clients include publishers, bookstores, and universities. TechReads is currently facing 
challenges because their data ingestion process is manual, inconsistent, and slow. They want to 
automate the entire pipeline—from data collection to storage, querying, and analytics.   
You have been hired as a Junior Data Engineer in their Data Engineering Team. Your first project 
involves designing a complete data pipeline that will:   
• 
Scrape product information from public e-commerce websites.   
• 
Store and query the extracted data in a MySQL relational database.   
• 
Automate scheduled data ingestion using Apache NiFi.   
• 
Integrate MongoDB as a secondary NoSQL store for semi-structured analytics.   
The company expects you to deliver a fully functioning prototype so they can evaluate your 
technical capabilities.   
 
Project Background   
TechReads wants to analyse trends in Data Engineering books sold online—pricing, authors, star 
ratings, and release years. Their goal is to supply publishers with insights such as:   
• 
Which books are trending?   
• 
Which authors consistently receive high ratings?   
• 
How pricing varies across platforms.   
To support this, they need a reliable and automated solution.   
Your tasks as part of the TechReads Data Engineering Team are outlined below.   
   
Task 1: Web Scraping    
TechReads wants an automated script to collect book information daily.   
Your role: Build a Python web scraper that extracts at least 15 Data Engineering books from an 
e-commerce site.   
At least FIVE (5) Data fields required (Preferable as below, but may vary):   
• 
Title   
• 
Author(s)   
• 
Year of publication   
• 
Star rating   
• 
Price   
You must:   
• 
Download webpage(s) using the Requests library.   
• 
Parse HTML using BeautifulSoup.   
• 
Structure your extracted data using Pandas.   
• 
Save the extracted data into a CSV file named techreads_books.csv.   
In your report, discuss about your code and rationale behind it within 200 - 250 words for the task. 
You must provide the screenshots of each operation/execution of the code created by you with 
proper commenting.   
Task 2: MySQL Database Pipeline    
TechReads uses MySQL for its structured analytics dashboards.   
Your role:   
• 
Install and configure MySQL locally.   
• 
Create a database called techreads_db.   
• 
Import your CSV file into a MySQL table.   
• 
Create a schema diagram (draw.io) representing your table.   
 
 
• 
Run a SQL query that extracts three selected columns, then sort results by any one 
column (e.g., price or rating).   
In your report, discuss about your code and rationale behind it within 200 - 250 words for the task. 
You must provide the screenshots of each operation/execution of the code created by you with 
proper commenting.   
Task 3: Apache NiFi Dataflow Automation    
TechReads wants to automate ingestion so that teams don’t run scripts manually.   
Your role:   
• 
Create an Apache NiFi dataflow under a folder named “DataEngineering”.   
• 
Configure NiFi to pull book data from your MySQL database, transform it if needed, and 
save it to a local directory in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or Avro).   
• 
Upload a video of the actual steps performed for carrying out the task (with voiceover 
and camera ON)   
Task 4: MongoDB Integration & Performance Comparison    
TechReads is exploring NoSQL databases to support flexible and scalable catalog analytics.   
Your role:   
• 
Convert your scraped data into JSON format.   
• 
Insert the JSON dataset into a MongoDB database.   
• 
Run a MongoDB query to filter books by attributes such as: o   
price, o  
 
publication year, o   
rating thresholds.   
• 
Compare query performance between MySQL (SQL) and MongoDB (NoSQL) using 
similar query logic.   
In your report, compare SQL database and NoSQL database and compare the query execution time 
for both the databases (within 200 - 250 words). You must provide the screenshots.   
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:   
• 
The cover page of the report must clearly list the names and student IDs of all four 
group members.   
• 
Task 3 (Apache NiFi Video): o   
Only one group member is required to record the 
NiFi demonstration video.   
o The video must include voiceover and camera ON while explaining 
the steps performed.   
• 
The report must also include reflection (Approx. 750 words) (strictly your own 
reflection, not generated using any AI tool) discussing:   
o Each members specific contribution to the group work, o  What they 
learnt from the task, o   
Challenges faced and how they were 
addressed.   
 
• 
All submissions must adhere strictly to the stated formatting, word limits, referencing 
style (IEEE), and file-naming conventions.

Assessment Success Guidance   
To achieve high marks, students should demonstrate more than basic task completion. Strong 
submissions will show:   
• 
Robust technical implementation – A fully functional end-to-end pipeline (Scraping → 
MySQL → NiFi → MongoDB) with accurate and well-structured outputs.   
• 
Clear justification of decisions – Explain why specific tools, schema designs, and database 
approaches were chosen.   
 
•  Critical comparison – Provide thoughtful analysis of SQL vs NoSQL in terms of 
performance, scalability, and suitability for the scenario.   
•  Clean and professional presentation – Well-commented code, organised screenshots, clear 
diagrams, and a structured report.   
•  Independent initiative – Evidence of deeper exploration (e.g., indexing, performance 
measurement, improved data handling).   
•  Confident demo performance – Clear explanation of individual contribution and ability to 
answer questions effectively.   
   
AI must be used to entirely to carry out this assessment and any model is permissible 
and allowed. 
Referencing    
References: Referencing any point in your discussion section(s). If you have used ideas from 
anywhere other than the lecture notes and tutorial examples (e.g., from a book, the Internet, or a 
fellow student) then include a reference showing where the code or ideas came from and label 
your code carefully to show which parts are your and which parts are borrowed.   
You should include your reference list at the end of your report. You must ensure you use the 
appropriate IEEE format for your subject area.    
Your referencing must use the IEEE referencing style IEEE Citation Guidelines.    
It is highly recommended that you use reference management software such as RefWorks that is 
provided by the university. Your report should have as many references as is required.    
It is your responsibility to ensure that you have actually read all the material you reference, and 
that the references provided in your report are legitimate and NOT AI-generated.   
Mitigating circumstances/late penalties     
Sometimes circumstances outside of your control may affect your studies and might prevent you 
from submitting work on time or attending an exam.   
The University offers the ability for students to request additional time to complete an 
assessment or to defer an examination to a later date. If you are finding yourself in such a 
situation, please speak to your Academic Guidance Tutor, the Roehampton Student Union  
(RSU) or someone in the Wellbeing team first, who can support you. Further details can be   
found on the mitigating circumstances portal.   
 
If you do not apply for or are not approved for Mitigating Circumstances, late penalties will 
apply. If work is submitted up to 14 days late, the mark will be capped at 40%; if it is over 14 
days late, it will not be marked.   
Resubmissions and Reassessment   
If you are required to resubmit this assessment or take part in reassessment, you will be notified 
via Moodle and your student email. Please ensure you check both regularly. Any reassessment 
tasks will follow the same learning outcomes and criteria.   
Submission Checklist    
Before you submit, ask yourself:   
Have I fully answered the assessment brief?   
Have I met the word count and formatting requirements?   
Is my referencing complete and accurate?   
Have I declared any AI use honestly?   
Have I proofread my work?   
Am I submitting through the correct platform before the deadline?
